#  YaMDb

## Input data
This joint project was written on the basis of the terms of reference with two other developers.
I was responsible for the genres, categories and titles.

## Description
The YaMDb project collects user feedback on works. The works themselves are not stored in YaMDb,
You can't watch a movie or listen to music here.
The works are divided into categories, and a genre can also be assigned from the list of preset ones.
Only the administrator can add works, categories and genres.
Grateful or indignant users leave text reviews for the works and put
product score in the range from one to ten (integer); from user ratings
an average assessment of the work is formed - rating. For one work, the user can
leave only one review.

## Programs for sending requests

* API testing via httpie - API console client.
If you like this console API client, [you can find installation instructions there, on the developers' website.](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/installation)

* API Testing with VS Code Extension
The extension [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) allows you to send HTTP requests directly from VS Code and view responses to them in the same interface.

* API Testing with Postman
Postman is a popular and convenient API client that can send requests and show responses, save request history and authentication data, and allow you to design and test API.
[Download Postman from the download page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) project and install it on your work machine.
